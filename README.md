When you first start the program u get the main menu screen that is pretty straightforward

In this screen the user is only able to write an username that is <= 7 so, and that cannot be blank to avoid all kinds of bugs in the next screen. 
After enter the username and clicking on the button "Chat", the user can start chat.

In this screen he can see the chat messages to his left, the people that are online to the right and type his messages in the input bar on the bottom of the screen.
Depending on wether the message is from the user or not, the message is displayed to the left (if not the user's message) or to the right leaving space for "Me" to be displayed in front of the message.
